Description:
===========
Dissolution is a post-apocalyptic roleplay schema for the NutScript framework
by Chessnut.

Installation:
===========
To install this schema, just place it in the gamemodes folder of the srcds directory.
You will then need to add +gamemode dissolution to your start-up line so the server
knows what gamemode to use.

The M9K weapons are included by default as a plugin under dissolution/plugins.
This allows weapons to be customized easier.
You can find some plugins at the official repository for NutScript plugins using
the link: https://github.com/Chessnut/NSPlugins

If you are using M9K weapons (by default you are), remember to read the installation
instructions under dissolution/plugins!

Content Notice:
===========
Content for the schema has been packaged into a Workshop add-on and compressed
to about 30 MB. This allows the content to be updated easily and easier for
installation. By default, the schema will have clients who join the server download
the content addon, which can be found at: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=182104437

Since it is a Workshop addon, you will notice that the content folder is NOT included.
To install the content, you will need to follow the instructions at the official
Garry's Mod wiki below:
